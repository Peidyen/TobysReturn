So, My Son and I created a game about 10 years ago when they were eight. 
It was called Buttercups Balloon Adventure, and it was a simple pop the balloon type game. 

We built it in Unity and Eddy did some of the coding in JavaScript along with creating the images. 
We used the sound of "ButterCups' barking' as the sound of the balloon popping.  

This is an homage to that game.  
In the interim years, Buttercup has passed away, but, Toby , her brother is still with us. 

This time it's Toby's Turn.  
The object is to bark and scare all of the unwanted 'critters' out of the yard. 

We've decided to post this code as an open-source project to show the basics of game development. 

This game is written in Python, with the PyGame engine. 
and we will likely port it to Android after the initial version.

This version is mostly complete.  
Enjoy, appreciate any thoughts people have on the code.
